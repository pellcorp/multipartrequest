Servlet MultipartRequest 2.0 README
-----------------------------------

This library uses some code from Apache Commons file upload.  Instead of creating a 
dependency to the file upload lib, the required code has been copied.  The following 
classes have been copied from Apache File Uploads library and in some cases modified
slightly.

src/net/iamvegan/multipartrequest/ProgressListener.java
src/org/apache/commons/fileupload/ParameterParser.java
src/org/apache/commons/fileupload/util/Streams.java
test/org/apache/commons/fileupload/MockHttpServletRequest.java
